# Grafana plugin 

This plugin serves as a starting point to integrate grafana with your channels. Right now is a rough draft that only gets a panel image and shows in a show header

This plugins needs some changes in the webapp that you can see [here](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp/compare/channelsubheader)
